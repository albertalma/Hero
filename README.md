# Hero
 Unreal Playground game to test AI examples and ideas that comes to my mind.
 
- AI Perception based on sight, making the agents change from "Normal" to "Detection"
- Targetting system based on the agent sight
- AI Cautious/Kung-fu circle using Environment Query System
- Animations to make strafes around the player
